# Curriculum vitae

## Job summary
We have been consistently involved in data networks, and have been involved in Internet-related work since its dawn.
After joining the company, he was involved in product development of LAN/WAN products and research and prototyping of intersystem connection mechanisms, and then became independent as a research group focusing on TCP/IP.
After being involved in promoting IPv6 development in the router development department, I was involved in new business development and cloud networks.
After developing new business, he proposed three technologies that he devised and patented (MSLB: load balancing technology, M46/SA46T: IPv6 transition technology, ME6: cloud-related technology) to the Internet standardization organization IETF. We worked on new business development while being conscious of the technology development process.

## Self-promotion
I quickly realized the future potential of TCP/IP and started related work, but I realized that it would be difficult to deal with it using only the development methods I had been using up until then.
I searched for a development method suitable for the Internet through IPv6 development promotion, and came up with my own methodology.
I am proud that I was able to use this methodology to practice and demonstrate the development of three types of technologies that I devised based on the cloud.
By disseminating and contributing to these activities within the company and the community, I was able to build a wide network of contacts in the Internet community.
Belongs to the research laboratory, transmission department, information department, bridge/router department (cross-information system), exchange department, information hardware department, exchange department, communication department, information software department/SE department, and is involved in transmission, exchange, and information before the Internet. With the expansion of the Internet, I have worked as a product engineer in the hottest areas at that time (intranet, SOHO, carrier IP, 3GPP ALL-IP, cloud).
